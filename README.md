# PlumpAI
Plump AI tournament

Plump AI runs on Node.js and is writen in TypeScript

1. Install node from here: https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Download or clone the repository to your computer.

3. Open the project folder (VS Code recommended).

4. Run 'npm install' in the terminal to install any dependencies

To make it easer to run typescript you can install ts-node and typescript globally:

run these in the terminal

'npm install -g ts-node'

'npm install -g typescript'

now you can run the simulation with:

'ts-node app.ts'

Good luck!
